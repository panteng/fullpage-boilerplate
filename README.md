# Fullpage-Boilerplate

A full-screen scrolling website boilerplate built using [fullPage.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) and [Velocity.js](http://julian.com/research/velocity/).

It comes with useful gulp tasks that automatically compile sass, bundle javascript modules, compress images, reload browsers and so on.
With the help of this boilerplate, you can build a wonderful full-screen scrolling website in a very short time.
